This repository contains the code used to create maps of gtown radio's listenership via geolocating ip addresses, 
as well as images of the map and an html version for web use.

Note: Python files were run in Google Colab, and you'll need to add your own api key for the first script

To recreate map: 
Run the ipaddressg_town.py script first and ipaddressg_townmapmaker.py second
